# 🍽️ FoodLink — Bridging Hunger and Surplus

> “The world produces enough food to feed everyone, yet millions go to bed hungry every night.  
> The problem is not scarcity — it’s distribution.”

**FoodLink** is more than just a website — it’s a mission.  
We connect restaurants, grocery stores, caterers, and individuals with NGOs, shelters, and people in need, ensuring that surplus food never goes to waste.

## 🌍 Why FoodLink?
Every year, **1.3 billion tons** of food is wasted globally.  
At the same time, **828 million people** struggle with hunger.  

The irony is heartbreaking — and it’s not due to a lack of resources, but the lack of a **bridge** between abundance and need.  
**FoodLink is that bridge.**
